## Misconceptations on Using Linear Regression

"The scatter plots of y x $x_{i}$ don't think this is linear so let's try Random Forest or Neural Network". Reality is that linear regression still is the work horse of Machine Learning.

## What Should be Linear in Linear Regressions?

Linear refers to the relationship between the parameters that you are estimating (e.g., β) and the outcome (e.g., yi). Hence, y=exβ+ϵ is linear, but y=eβx+ϵ is not. A linear model means that your estimate of your parameter vector can be written β^=∑iwiyi, where the {wi} are weights determined by your estimation procedure. Linear models can be solved algebraically in closed form, while many non-linear models need to be solved by numerical maximization using a computer.
